  "description": "2011-05-27 Vienna XXi. district (Bisamberg, 221 msm Quadrant 7664/3).German name: (Echte) Balsam-PappelThis is either 'true' P. balsamifera or a hybrid where it is involved as a parent; the tree is native to Northern America and cultivated here in Austria in parks, but also for fast-growing wood fuel plantations (hybrids usually are used for the latter).This specimen here grew between a road and a vineyard, it certainly didn't look like it were cultivated for forestry, and it even might be an escapee growing wild here.",
