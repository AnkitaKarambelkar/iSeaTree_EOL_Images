  "description": "2011-10-21 Lower Austria, district Schwechat (160 msm Quadrant 7865/1).Native to the habitat (and typical in habitus here) but possibly planted here, as the habitat is man-made:This is the \"new\" river bed of Schwechat river - the river once flew further west (crossing over to nearby Vienna); when A4 motorway was built the old river bed was cut off and so-called \"Kalter Gang\" (an old mill stream - side canal of old Schwechat river) was expanded to what is now lower Schwechat river bed. Of course, <i>Populus nigra</i> also could have conquered the new habitat without any help by humans.",
