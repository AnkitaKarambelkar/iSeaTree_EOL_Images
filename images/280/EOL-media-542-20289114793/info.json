  "description": "Pinus longaevaGreat Basin bristlecone pine. Several disjunct populations in California, Utah, and Nevada.  The groves at or near the timber lines in the White Mountains of California and Wheeler Peak in Nevada contain the oldest living trees (clonal colonies of aspens are older.)  Groves at lower levels contain trees that have an upright appearance and resemble the specimen photographed.  The pollen cones shown will become even redder as they mature.  Those interested in learning more should read the entry provided by the USDA Fire Effects Information Service, by far the most cogent discussion of the species :  <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinlon/all.html\">www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinlon/all.html</a>Photographed at Regional Parks Botanic Garden located in Tilden Regional Park near Berkeley, CA.",
