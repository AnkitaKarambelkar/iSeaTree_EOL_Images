  "description": "Yellow Buckeye flowers at Craggy Gardens on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Ohio Buckeyes have stamens longer than the petals, making them poke out of the flowers. Since these don't look that way, I assume it is a Yellow Buckeye (<i>Aesculus flava</i>) tree. Their natural range extends into the Appalachians and into North Carolina.",
