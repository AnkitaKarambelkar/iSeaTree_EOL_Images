  "description": "Arbutus menziesiiPacific madrone.  Grows from Vancouver Island in British Columbia south to Baja California.  Common in redwood and Douglas-fir forests, less so elsewhere.  A desirable ornamental,  susceptibility to various diseases and cultural requirements keeps it from being more widely used in horticulture. Fine cabinetry and furniture has been made from the wood of madrones.  Photographed in Regional Parks Botanic Garden located in Tilden Regional Park near Berkeley, CA.",
