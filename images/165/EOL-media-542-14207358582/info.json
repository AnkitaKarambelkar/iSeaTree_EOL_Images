  "description": "My friend Gerry Doyle made this photo while I held the ladder on which he was standing. The caterpillar was on the bark of a Pin oak, Quercus palustris.It is best not to handle tent caterpillars with one's bare hands because their fine hairs (cilia) contain skin irritants which may cause dermatitis in some people.Made at Gambrills, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on May 17, 2014.",
