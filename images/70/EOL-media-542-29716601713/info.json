  "description": "Corylus cornuta ssp. californicabeaked hazelnut.  The beaked hazelnut, never common in its range from California to British Columbia, has provided food for animals and humans for millennia.  The nutmeats can be eaten right out of the cracked hull  or prepared in a number of ways.  Some male catkins are visible, a small reddish-flower will appear after all leaves are gone.  Photographed at Regional Parks Botanic Garden located in Tilden Regional Park near Berkeley, CA  ",
